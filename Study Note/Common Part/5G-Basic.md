## I. Background
5G, as its name, is the fifth generation of celullar networks. Cellular networks has been rapidly evolving since its first launch many years ago. 5G delivers a **high speeds, low latency, more reliability**, and **improved flexibility** for wireless services better than previous cellular networks.

Based on the image, we can conclude that researchers moving forwards with using 5G because there is a **gradual increase** in the number of mobile user, advanced mobile cloud gaming, high-definitions vidoes, and even the usage of IoT devices, such as smart meters and energy monitoring systems.

## II. Key Enabling Technologies / Characteristics of 5G
**Massive MIMO**: refers to employing a very large number of antennas, further magnifying the benefits of MIMO. 
> Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends to improve signal quality and boost data rates.

**Milimetre Wave (mmWave)**:5G has shorter wavelengths compared to traditional cellular frequencies, resulting in ==higher data capacity== but also susceptibility to signal attenuation from obstacles and weather.
> mmWave range between 30-300GHz

**Small Cells**: These are smaller, low-power cellular base stations strategically deployed in dense areas ==to enhance network coverage and capacity==, particularly for ==mmWave frequencies== which have limited range.

**Li-Fi**: Li-Fi, short for Light Fidelity, is a technology that uses visible and ultraviolet light for high-speed data communication. While not directly related to cellular networks, it offers a complementary high-bandwidth option for specific applications requiring short-range, secure connectivity.

**Edge Computing**: This involves processing data closer to the source, on smart devices or the network edge, rather than relying solely on centralized cloud servers. This ==reduces latency and improves responsiveness== for applications like IoT and real-time communication.

**Beamforming**: This technique ==focuses radio waves into narrow beams== in the direction of devices, improving signal strength and reducing interference, especially beneficial for mmWave communications due to their directional nature.

**Network Slicing**: 5G introduces the concept of network slicing, which allows network operators to ==create multiple virtual networks== within a single physical infrastructure. Each network slice can be customized to meet the specific requirements of different applications, industries, or user groups.

## III. Architecture
The architecture of the 5G network is based on three main components: the User Equipment (UE), the Radio Access Network (RAN), and the Core Network (CN).

**User Equipment**: The User Equipment (UE) is the device that connects to the 5G network. It can be a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or any other device that supports 5G connectivity. The UE communicates with the network through the Radio Access Network (RAN) and accesses the internet and other services provided by the Core Network (CN).

**Radio Access Network(RAN)**: The Radio Access Network (RAN) is responsible for providing wireless connectivity between the User Equipment (UE) and the Core Network (CN). The RAN includes the base stations, antennas, and other equipment that provide wireless coverage in a particular area. The 5G RAN is designed to operate in three frequency bands: low, mid, and high (mmWave). 

**Core Network(CN)**: The Core Network (CN) is responsible for managing and directing the traffic between the User Equipment (UE) and the internet. It includes the servers, routers, switches, and other equipment that provide the necessary infrastructure for the 5G network. The 5G Core Network is designed to support multiple use cases, including enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communications.
