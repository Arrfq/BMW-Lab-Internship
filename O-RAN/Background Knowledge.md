## ORAN
### What is ORAN?
An Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) is a nonproprietary version of the Radio Access Network (RAN) system that allows interoperation between cellular network equipment provided by different vendors.

### What is Its Goal?
The future goal for ORAN is for any hardware and software in the cellular network to interoperate both seamlessly and securely regardless of its originating vendor.ORAN today may have multiple vendors, but the radio unit (RU) software comes from the same company that manufactures the antennae, while the Distribution Unit (DU) and Centralized Unit (CU) could originate from another company.
Also, as noted above, RAN traditionally has been a proprietary (closed) segment of the network. Currently, it is the last remaining portion of the network that is predominantly proprietary.

## vRAN
### What is VRAN?
The disaggregation of hardware and software for the radio access network is known as vRAN (Virtualized RAN). It involves the separation of traditional hardware from the software that operates the base stations, RU, DU, and CU.
Because it evolves hardware-driven functions into virtualized (or software-based) functions, vRAN is often seen as the next step in cellular network evolution—most notably in the advancement of 5G. That said, a vRAN can still be a proprietary solution requiring both hardware and software to be provided by the same vendor (which maintains vendor lock-in).

## OvRAN
### What is OvRAN?
OvRAN (Open Virtualized RAN) is a nonproprietary RAN that has disaggregated hardware from software—that is, it's an open and virtualized RAN.
With OvRAN, service providers aren’t locked into a single solution and have the freedom to choose their own (best-of-breed) components based on their specific needs. Enabling this flexibility in choice is the overall goal for OvRAN.

## RAN
### What is RAN?
A RAN is a key segment of a mobile telecommunications system that uses cellular radio connections to link individual devices to other parts of a network.
A RAN serves different generations of mobile networking evolution beginning with the first generation of the technology, known as 1G, and culminating today in 5G, which is the fifth generation of cellular technology.
Radio access technology is the first segment in the cellular network, interconnecting end devices such as mobile phones, tablets, computers, or Internet of Things (IoT) machines to each other and to services through the mobile packet core.
