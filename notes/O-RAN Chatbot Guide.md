# O-RAN Chatbot Usage Guide
The O-RAN Chatbot is taken from [Nvidia Generative AI Examples repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples/blob/main/experimental/oran-chatbot-multimodal/README.md), edited to align BMW Lab interest. The chatbot implements Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that uses O-RAN Documentations specifically as the knowledge base. It is designed to answer questions about O-RAN specifications and standards according to the O-RAN specification documents.

This document created as guidance in using the chatbot.
