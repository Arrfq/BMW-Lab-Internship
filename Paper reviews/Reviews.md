## [Comparative Study of RSS-based Indoor Positioning Techniques on Two Different Wi-Fi Frequency Bands](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9158211)

Keywords: Bandwidth, WKNN, RSS fingerprinting

In this paper, comparative analysis of localization performance of Wi-Fi based indoor positioning approaches on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands are carried out. Extensive experiments are performed to derive empirical path-loss model which takes into account random nature of multipath fading and for choosing optimal value of k for WKNN algorithm. Then, positions of target user for a set of test points are estimated and localization errors are compared. Results indicate that using 5GHz frequency band gives higher localization accuracy in both Wi-Fi based approaches. Due to multipath propagation characteristics of indoor environment, there is higher localization error with path-loss model based approach.

## [Study on WiFi-based Indoor Positioning Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10393117) 

Keywords: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost

In this paper, it is studied machine learning algorithms for indoor positioning using WiFi data. The experimental results revealed that the performance of the Random Forest and boosting algorithms was favorable. In this experiment, the dataset was insufficient considering the number of features, and adequate preprocessing, such as normalization, was not carried out.
