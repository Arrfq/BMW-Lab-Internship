# Introduction

Near-RT RIC (Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller) is a logical function playing a crucial role in enabling near-real-time control and optimization of Radio Access Network (RAN) elements and resources. It achieves this by performing fine-grained data collection and executing actions over the E2 interface. Essentially, Near-RT RIC enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of RAN operations. While Non-RT RIC (Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller), within the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) framework, serves a different purpose. It acts as a logical function responsible for managing the content exchanged across the A1 interface. The Non-RT RIC consists of two key components: the Non-RT RIC Framework and the Non-RT RIC Applications. These also exists xApp (Extended Application), an application specifically designed to run on the Near-RT RIC platform. It can be composed of one or more microservices. During the onboarding process, an xApp specifies the data it consumes and provides. Importantly, xApps are independent of the Near-RT RIC itself and can be developed by third-party entities. The E2 interface establishes a direct link between an xApp and the underlying RAN functionalities.
