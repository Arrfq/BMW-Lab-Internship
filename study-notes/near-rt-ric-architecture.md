# Introduction

Near-RT RIC (Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller) is a logical function playing a crucial role in enabling near-real-time control and optimization of Radio Access Network (RAN) elements and resources. It achieves this by performing fine-grained data collection and executing actions over the E2 interface. Essentially, Near-RT RIC enhances the efficiency and responsiveness of RAN operations. While Non-RT RIC (Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller), within the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) framework, serves a different purpose. It acts as a logical function responsible for managing the content exchanged across the A1 interface. The Non-RT RIC consists of two key components: the Non-RT RIC Framework and the Non-RT RIC Applications. These also exists xApp (Extended Application), an application specifically designed to run on the Near-RT RIC platform. It can be composed of one or more microservices. During the onboarding process, an xApp specifies the data it consumes and provides. Importantly, xApps are independent of the Near-RT RIC itself and can be developed by third-party entities. The E2 interface establishes a direct link between an xApp and the underlying RAN functionalities.

# More About Its Functions...

A. Database and Related SDL (Shared Data Layer) Services enables both reading and writing of critical information related to Radio Access Network (RAN) and User Equipment (UE). It also supports other data necessary for specific use cases. Essentially, it acts as a bridge between applications and the underlying data storage.
A.1. UE-NIB (User Equipment Network Information Base) serves as a repository for essential network-related information specific to individual user equipment. It contains details about the UEâ€™s connection status, capabilities, and other relevant data.
A.2. R-NIB (Radio Network Information Base) is responsible for storing and managing network-related information at the radio access level. It includes data about cell configurations, neighboring cells, and radio resources.
A.3. SDL (Shared Data Layer): performs several key functions, utilizied by xApps; subscribing to database notification services (xApps can receive real-time updates when relevant data changes in the database), reading data (xApps retrieve information from the stored data), writing and modifying data (xApps can update or modify data stored in the database). The SDL plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between xApps and the underlying database, allowing them to efficiently access and manipulate relevant information.
