# Threat Intelligence Survey and Collection

Threat intelligence survey and collection in cybersecurity blue teaming involve the systematic gathering and analysis of information about potential or current attacks that threaten the security of an organization. Blue teams use this intelligence to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries, which helps them to strengthen their defenses and prepare for potential cyber threats.

### First of all, survey.

This is the initial phase where blue teams identify and collect data on various cyber threats. They may use open-source intelligence (OSINT), social media, dark web monitoring, and other sources to gather information. The ‘survey’ phase in threat intelligence for cybersecurity blue teaming is a critical step that involves the systematic collection of information about potential or current cyber threats. This phase is about gathering as much data as possible to understand the threat landscape and identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.

1. Data Collection: Blue teams collect data from a variety of sources, including open-source intelligence (OSINT), social media, dark web forums, and more. They use tools and techniques to monitor these sources for any signs of malicious activity or chatter that could indicate a looming threat.
2. Thread Identification: The collected data is then analyzed to identify potential threats. This involves looking for patterns, anomalies, and indicators of compromise (IoCs) that could signal an attack in progress or a planned one.
3. Prioritization: Not all threats are equal, so blue teams prioritize them based on factors such as the potential impact on the organization, the likelihood of an attack, and the value of the targeted assets.
4. Reporting: The findings from the survey phase are compiled into reports that provide actionable insights. These reports help inform decision-makers within the organization about the current threat landscape and guide them in strengthening their defenses.

The survey phase is essential because it sets the foundation for all subsequent actions in threat intelligence. By understanding what threats exist and where vulnerabilities lie, blue teams can develop targeted strategies to protect against cyber attacks. It’s a proactive approach that aims to stay one step ahead of potential adversaries.

### And then, collection.

In this phase, blue teams actively gather detailed information about specific threats. This can include malware samples, attack patterns, and indicators of compromise (IoCs). The ‘collection’ phase in threat intelligence for cybersecurity blue teaming is a detailed process that involves gathering specific information about cyber threats. This phase is crucial for building a comprehensive understanding of the threats that an organization may face.

1. Data Gathering: Blue teams use a variety of tools and techniques to collect data from multiple sources. This includes network traffic analysis, log file examination, and the use of specialized software to capture and analyze data.
2. Malware Analysis: When malware is detected, it is collected for analysis. This involves examining the malware’s code, behavior, and communication patterns to understand its capabilities and potential impact.
3. Threat Hunting: Blue teams actively search for threats that have not been detected by traditional security measures. This proactive approach involves looking for anomalies or patterns that could indicate a security incident.
4. Information Sharing: Collected threat intelligence is often shared with other organizations and security communities. This collaboration helps improve the overall security posture by leveraging shared knowledge and experiences.

The collection phase is essential because it provides the raw data needed for the subsequent analysis phase. By collecting detailed information about threats, blue teams can better understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by adversaries, which in turn helps them to develop more effective defense strategies.

### Those are the main tasks, but we need to analyze and disseminate too.

The collected data is then analyzed to identify trends, assess risks, and determine the potential impact on the organization. The insights gained from the analysis are shared with relevant stakeholders within the organization to inform decision-making and response strategies. By conducting threat intelligence surveys and collection, blue teams can proactively defend against cyber attacks by staying informed about emerging threats and adjusting their defense strategies accordingly.

### These are the necessary tools to do the tasks!

1. Network Scanners: Tools like Nmap, Masscan, and Angry IP Scanner are used for network discovery and mapping.
2. Vulnerability Scanners: OpenVAS, Nessus, and Nexpose help identify vulnerabilities within systems.
3. Security Monitoring Tools: Sysmon, Kibana, and Logstash are used for system monitoring and data visualization.
4. Threat Intelligence Platforms: Maltego, MISP, and ThreatConnect provide platforms for sharing and analyzing threat intelligence.
5. Malware Analysis Tools: CyberChef, YARA, and velociraptor are used for analyzing malware samples.
6. Incident Response Tools: Tools like chainsaw and freq assist in forensic analysis during incident response.
