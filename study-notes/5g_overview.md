# What exactly is... a 5G technology?

5G, which stands for fifth-generation, represents the latest advancement in mobile networks. Its purpose is to provide users with ultra-fast data speeds, minimal latency, enhanced reliability, and greater network capacity. Additionally, 5G aims to offer a consistent user experience to a broader audience.

5G New Radio (5G NR), on the other hand, specifically refers to the radio access technology developed for 5G networks. It serves as the standard for 5G deployments, ensuring seamless communication between devices and the network infrastructure.

# And, what are included as its technologies?

1. OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) is a modulation technique that distributes a digital signal across multiple channels. Its primary purpose is to reduce interference, especially in wireless communication systems.
2. 5G New Radio (NR) Air Interface builds upon OFDM. It enhances flexibility and scalability, allowing for broader 5G coverage and connectivity. By leveraging 5G NR, we can extend access to more devices and people across various scenarios.
3. Wider Bandwidth Technologies exists so that 5G can operate across different frequency bands, including:
    1. Sub-6 GHz: These lower bands provide wide coverage and are suitable for urban and rural areas.
    2. mmWave (Millimeter Wave): These higher bands (e.g., 24 GHz and above) offer extreme capacity, multi-Gbps throughput, and low latency.
    3. The combination of sub-6 GHz and mmWave enables a comprehensive 5G experience.
4. High-frequency bands (mmWave) can overlay existing LTE networks. The LTE Overlay provides on-demand high bandwidth, alleviating congestion in mid- and low-band LTE (and eventually 5G) scenarios.

# Explain the terms and systems regarding 5G!

5G aims to create a network that seamlessly connects everyone and everything. This includes not only people but also machines, objects, and various devices. The vision is to enable a highly interconnected world through advanced communication technologies.
1. Non-Standalone 5G (NSA) represents the initial stage of 5G deployment. It involves overlaying a 5G New Radio (NR) access network onto an existing 4G LTE network core. Essentially, it combines the strengths of 4G and 5G to provide enhanced connectivity. In the non-standalone (NSA) deployment, the focus is primarily on eMBB. This approach provides greater data bandwidth while moderately improving latency for both 5G NR and 4G LTE. Other that that, URLLC also ensures ultra-responsive connections. It also offers high-speed mobility, enabling seamless communication even in dynamic scenarios.
2. Standalone 5G takes a different approach. It utilizes the 5G NR access network alongside a completely new 5G network core. This standalone architecture is designed to unlock the full potential of 5G capabilities.

The 5G system encompasses various use cases, each serving specific purposes. And to break them down (since these names are also mentioned above):
1. eMBB (Enhanced Mobile BroadBand) aims to achieve peak download speeds exceeding 10 Gbps. It focuses on enhancing mobile broadband services, allowing users to access data-intensive applications seamlessly.
2. URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications) defines stringent requirements for 5G networks:
    1. High Reliability (99.99%): Ensuring dependable communication.
    2. Extremely Low Latencies (below one ms): Facilitating real-time interactions.
    3. Support for Low Data Rates (bps/kbps): Catering to diverse device needs.
3. mMTC (Massive Machine Type Communications) addresses the connectivity of a large number of devices with 1 million low-powered, low-cost, low-complexity devices per square kilometer. These devices can operate with a battery life of up to ten years.

# What's the foundation for those technologies?

Milimeter waves, small cell, massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), beamforming, and full duplex. To add more of its context soon.
