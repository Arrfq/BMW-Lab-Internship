# Software Radio Suites - Radio Access Network

## Overview
srsRAN is an open-source project developed by Software Radio Systems. Its primary focus is on creating software radio implementations for both 4G (LTE) and 5G networks. srsRAN contributes to the openness and flexibility of radio access networks by providing accessible and adaptable software solutions. Its commitment to open-source principles empowers operators, researchers, and developers to build efficient and customizable cellular networks. It's an open-source 5G CU/DU (Central Unit and Distributed Unit). It adheres to both 3GPP and O-RAN Alliance standards, covering the complete L1/2/3 stack. The softwareâ€™s portability across processor architectures allows it to scale from low-power embedded systems to cloudRAN, making it a robust platform for mobile wireless research and development.

## Software Radio Suites
Software Radio Suites refer to collections of software implementations designed for radio communication systems. These suites cover various aspects of radio networks, from signal processing to network management. srsRAN offers a comprehensive collection of software radio implementations. These implementations are written in portable C++ and are designed to run on Linux platforms. The suite covers various network elements, including User Equipment (UE), eNodeB (base station), and components of the Evolved Packet Core (EPC).

## The Build and Its Benefits
srsRAN is committed to openness and transparency. It is released under the AGPLv3 (Affero General Public License version 3), ensuring that the source code remains accessible and modifiable by the community. This open-source approach encourages collaboration and fosters innovation. Unlike isolated components, srsRAN provides a full-stack solution for radio access networks. It spans from the I/Q (baseband signal) level to the IP (network layer). By offering end-to-end functionality, srsRAN simplifies network deployment and management. srsRAN is designed to be portable across different hardware platforms and architectures. It can run on a wide range of devices, from small-scale systems like Raspberry Pi to large-scale data centers. This flexibility allows operators to choose hardware that best suits their deployment scenarios.
