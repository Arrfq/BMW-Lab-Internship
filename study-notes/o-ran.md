# Open Radio Access Network

## Overview
O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network) represents a highly disaggregated approach to deploying mobile fronthaul and midhaul networks, built entirely on cloud-native principles. It is an evolution of the Next Generation RAN (NG-RAN) architecture, which was initially introduced by the GSMA’s 3GPP in their release 15 (5G version 1) technical specification (TS 38.401). The O-RAN Alliance was established to advance NG-RAN philosophies, expanding upon the scope originally outlined by the 3GPP. With more than 160 member companies, the O-RAN alliance issues specifications and releases open-source software under the auspices of the Linux Foundation.

The ultimate objective of O-RAN is to enable seamless and secure interoperability between hardware and software components within cellular networks, regardless of their original vendors. In the current O-RAN landscape, multiple vendors may be involved. For instance, the radio unit (RU) software typically comes from the same company that manufactures the antennae, while the Distribution Unit (DU) and Centralized Unit (CU) could originate from different companies. It’s worth noting that historically, the Radio Access Network (RAN) has been a closed and proprietary segment of the network. However, O-RAN aims to change this by promoting openness and standardization.

O-RAN is built upon interoperable lower layer splits, but determining the optimal location for this split is a complex challenge. It involves balancing RU simplification, support for advanced multipoint radio frequency capabilities, and the requirements of front haul transport. These splits are assigned numerical values to facilitate comparison among various options. Higher-numbered splits reside lower in the protocol stack, with less functionality deployed below the RU split. The lower layer splits occur within the protocol stack below the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Options include placing the split between the MAC and Physical (PHY) layers (Split 6), within the PHY layer (Split 7), or between the PHY layer and RF functionality (Split 8).

## Logical Architecture
O-RAN decomposes the existing Baseband Unit (BBU) into two functional components: the Distributed Unit (DU) and Central Unit (CU). By adopting modern control user plane separation (CUPS), the CU can be further split into control plane (CU-CP) and user plane (CU-UP) functions. This architectural shift offers technical advantages, including cost reduction and support for dynamic multiaccess edge compute (MEC) clouds. The deployment of NG-RAN components occurs across fronthaul, midhaul, and backbone networks, with open interfaces defined at different layers. The choice of component instantiation depends on service requirements.

## The Virtualized
vRAN, short for Virtualized Radio Access Network, marks a significant transformation in the architecture of cellular networks by decoupling hardware and software components. This separation encompasses various elements such as base stations, Radio Units (RUs), Distributed Units (DUs), and Centralized Units (CUs). Unlike traditional setups where hardware dictates functionality, vRAN shifts towards a software-centric approach, virtualizing core functions.

Primarily, vRAN is hailed as a pivotal advancement in the journey towards 5G adoption. By transitioning from hardware-dependent operations to software-driven processes, it promises enhanced flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in network management. This evolution holds the potential to revolutionize how networks are deployed and managed, paving the way for more dynamic and adaptable infrastructures.

However, it's essential to note that while vRAN introduces a paradigm shift, it doesn't necessarily guarantee complete openness. In some cases, vRAN implementations may still be proprietary solutions, where both hardware and software components are provided by a single vendor. This scenario raises concerns about vendor lock-in, where reliance on a specific vendor's ecosystem could limit interoperability and hinder innovation within the network environment. Thus, while vRAN offers significant promise, ensuring open standards and interoperability remains crucial for realizing its full potential in fostering a vibrant and competitive telecommunications landscape.

## The Open Virtualized
OvRAN, or Open Virtualized Radio Access Network, represents a departure from proprietary RAN architectures by untethering hardware from software, fostering an open and virtualized ecosystem. In essence, OvRAN promotes interoperability and freedom of choice for service providers, allowing them to assemble bespoke solutions tailored to their unique requirements. By embracing OvRAN, providers can break free from vendor lock-in, selecting the most optimal components from a range of offerings.

The fundamental principle driving OvRAN is the empowerment of service providers to craft RAN deployments that align precisely with their strategic objectives and operational needs. This flexibility extends beyond mere hardware and software selection, encompassing the broader ecosystem of network infrastructure and services. OvRAN heralds a new era of openness and innovation in the telecommunications landscape, where collaboration and interoperability drive efficiency and drive advancements in network technology.

Moreover, OvRAN not only fosters diversity in technology providers but also cultivates competition, driving vendors to continually innovate and refine their offerings to meet the evolving demands of the market. In this way, OvRAN serves as a catalyst for progress, propelling the industry towards more agile, adaptable, and cost-effective RAN solutions. Ultimately, the vision of OvRAN is to democratize access to advanced telecommunications capabilities, empowering service providers to deliver enhanced connectivity experiences to end-users while fostering a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and collaboration.

## Then, What Is Radio Open Network Itself?
The Radio Access Network (RAN) stands as a critical component within mobile telecommunications infrastructure, facilitating cellular radio connections to interconnect individual devices with broader network systems. This network segment has played a pivotal role across various generations of mobile technology, spanning from the inception of the first generation (1G) to the latest evolution, currently represented by 5G technology.

At its core, the RAN represents the initial gateway within the cellular network, establishing the vital linkages between end-user devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and a myriad of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Through a complex interplay of radio access technologies, the RAN enables seamless communication and data exchange between these devices and the wider array of services offered via the mobile packet core.

Beyond its foundational role in connectivity, the RAN serves as the bedrock for ongoing innovation and advancement within the telecommunications sector. With each successive generation, from the advent of digital cellular networks to the emergence of broadband wireless technologies, the RAN has evolved to meet escalating demands for speed, capacity, and reliability. Notably, the advent of 5G has ushered in a new era of connectivity characterized by ultra-fast data rates, ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity, all underpinned by a highly sophisticated and adaptable RAN infrastructure.

## The Next Generation
The NG-RAN defines the Distributed Unit (DU) and Central Unit (CU), along with interfaces like F1, E1, Xn, and NG connecting them to the core network. However, it lacks details on service management and interfaces needed for orchestrated cloud environments. The RU-DU interface remains unaddressed. Existing Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) standards, though modified by vendors, connect RRU to BBU. With 5G’s bandwidth demands, the O-RAN Alliance aims to define new Open Fronthaul interfaces between DU and RU, overcoming limitations of current implementations.

## Layers Behind The Scene
O-RAN ensures openness by separating hardware and software into three layers:
1. Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Merchant Silicon: Includes x86 processors.
2. Hardware Abstraction Layer: Sits between the silicon and the application layer.
3. Application Layer: Where RAN functions reside.
   
The O-RAN alliance mandates vendor-agnostic layers and has defined requirements for a cloud platform that executes O-RAN network functions—the O-RAN Cloud Platform (O-Cloud). Deploying O-RAN functions on x86 hardware within cloud-native environments (using lightweight containers) requires robust data plane acceleration. Since these functions lack Kernel access, solutions may vary for each O-RAN CNF. Techniques like DPDK and FD.io, or advanced approaches like the Metaswitch Composable Network Applications Platform Packet Processing Engine (CNAP/CPPE), play a crucial role.

## How Does It Work?
O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network) works by transforming the traditional cellular network architecture to be more open, flexible, and interoperable. It enables a more open and adaptable cellular network, fostering innovation and collaboration among vendors.

1. Network Basics: A mobile network consists of two main parts: the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network. The RAN connects user devices (like phones) to the network via antennas and base stations. The Core Network handles authentication, routing, charging, and connectivity to the wider internet.
2. Evolution of Networks: Cellular networks have evolved from 1G (analog voice) to 5G (high-speed data and machine communication). Traditionally, RAN equipment from different vendors was challenging to mix due to proprietary interfaces.
3. Open RAN Approach: O-RAN aims to change this by promoting openness and interoperability. It decouples hardware and software into three layers: COTS merchant silicon, a hardware abstraction layer, and an application layer where RAN functions reside. O-RAN allows mixing and matching components and opens interfaces inside base stations.
