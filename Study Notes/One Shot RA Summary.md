# Summary: [Modeling and Estimation of One-Shot Random Access for Finite-User Multichannel Slotted ALOHA Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6211364)

## Abstract
This paper presents a combinatorial model and approximation formulas to estimate the average number of suc- cessful and collided users for a one-shot random access in finite- user multichannel slotted ALOHA systems.
>ALOHA: One of random access protocol. Divided into Pure and Slotted Aloha
>
> - Pure Aloha: In this basic type of ALOHA, a Base Station (BS) can send data anytime it is ready, without checking whether the channel is free. Successful transfers are indicated by an ACK (acknowledgment) from the receiver. If the ACK does not arrive after a random amount of time, the data is resent after a random delay.
>
>   Assumptions in Pure Aloha:
>
>   - All frames have the same length.
>   - Stations cannot generate a frame while transmitting or trying to transmit. That is, while a station is sending or trying to resend a frame, it cannot be allowed to generate more frames to send.
>   - The population of stations attempting to transmit (both new transmission and retransmissions) follows a Poisson distribution.
>
> - Slotted aloha: In this type of ALOHA, frame is transmitted in a discrete time slots that is given by a signal broadcasted by a special BS. This TS is equivalent to the frame length. If a BS is ready to send data, it waits until the next TS arrives.

The aim of the paper "Modeling and Estimation of One-Shot Random Access for Finite-User Multichannel Slotted ALOHA Systems" is to investigate the transient behavior of the random access channels accessed by a known number of machine-type communication (MTC) devices in a short observation interval. The analytical model proposed in the paper is used to derive the number of successful and collided users in one-shot random access for finite-user multichannel slotted ALOHA systems. The model is based on a combinatorial approach and uses equations (2) to (6) to estimate the average number of successful and collided RAOs in each access cycle.
