## ðŸ“šUnderstanding OSC

OSC or O-RAN Software Community is an open source project collaborated by O-RAN alliance and Linux Foundation which goals is to develop reference software components based on 3GPP and O-RAB Alliance specisification.

The Integration and Testing (INT) project within OSC is responsible for testing the requirements documented in each release for end-to-end and use case testing. The document also outlines the infrastructure and activities of the three OSC Community Laboratories, which were built to facilitate integration and interoperability testing among different projects. The labs are located in New Jersey, Silicon Valley, and Taiwan, and they play a crucial role in the development of the open-source reference implementation of the O-RAN solution.

OSC is crucial in driving the advancement of cellular technology and promoting openness in the RAN industry. It also discusses the role of open source software in enabling modular, open, intelligent, efficient, and agile radio access networks aligned with the architecture specified by O-RAN Alliance. This open-source approach promotes vendor diversity in the RAN industry and interoperability to run on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) servers, which is crucial for breaking the dominance of proprietary systems. Additionally, OSC provides a platform for direct feedback on the O-RAN specification, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of the standards. 

The testing and integration of the OSC O-RAN software architecture is a significant challenge due to the need to bond different components developed by various entities, and OSC addresses this challenge by providing a testbed to verify interoperability between components and provide a common framework for discovering, reserving, using, and testing 5G networks and use cases. below is the connection between O-RAN architecture and OSC Projects
