The image above is the infrastructure of the network which plays a role of the access network, which provides user access, and the core network, which connects different parts of the network and acts as a gateway to other networks. Providers are decentralizing VBUs inside Base Band Unit (BBU) pools for cost reduction and Resource sharing. Virtualizing BBUs into virtual machines is to prepare future connections, disaggregating control and user plans for flexibility, and optimizing the system with open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  to attract more vendors, lower companyâ€™s spending, and improve competition and information. The O-RAN Alliance, known as the open RUN organization, is primarily composed of mobile network operators, vendors, and academia.


##Open RAN Architecture

For this O-RAN prototype, it focuses on the non-real-time RIC, new real-time RIC, central unit (CU), and distributed unit (D1Uu). The non-real-time RIC is responsible for energy management and machine learning training. The real-time RIC manages ideologies and case management with more controls. The CU and D1Uu are connected through different interfaces. Furthermore, the audio effect architecture is responsible for distributed unit processing. The architecture consists of a high-level functional block with the rse, mac, and hifi layers. The audio system's functional blocks include the audio OM agent, F1 AP, and the user plane. The F1 AP connects to the CU and controls the user plan for data transfer. The presentation also touches on the entities and threat architecture for the audio high layer.
