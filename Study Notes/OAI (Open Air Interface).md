# Understanding OpenAirInterface 

## ðŸ“šOAI

OpenAirInterface is an open-source software platform developed by the OpenAirInterface Software Alliance (OSA) to create an ecosystem for open-source software/hardware development for the core network and access network of 3GPP cellular networks. It implements the 3GPP stack, including the radio access network (eNB, gNB, 4G, 5G UE) and the core network (EPC and 5G-CN). The platform offers a flexible and open LTE ecosystem, providing a software-based implementation of the LTE system, allowing the development of LTE base stations, user equipment, and core networks on commercial off-the-shelf hardware. The OSA itself is a non-profit organization that oversees the development, quality control, and promotion of the OpenAirInterface software packages, which are used by academic and industrial communities for various use-cases. The platform was created by EURECOM and is aimed at establishing an open cellular ecosystem for flexible and low-cost 4G/5G deployment and experimentations. It is designed to be agnostic to the hardware RF platforms and has been used in interoperability tests with commercial LTE-enabled mobile devices and EPC prototypes.
