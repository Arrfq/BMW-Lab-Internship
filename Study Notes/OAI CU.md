## ves
The file of ves.c is a part of a component handling Virtual Event Stream (VES) functionality within the OpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance project. This code initializes the VES component based on configuration settings and prepares templates for various types of VES messages. It includes error handling for invalid or incomplete configurations and static variables for storing templates and status flags. The ves_init function initializes the VES component, while comments provide insight into the purpose of various parts of the code. At ves_internal.c, it handles HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML documents, over the internet) requests, potentially within the context of the VES functionality. The code initializes the VES subsystem, sets up logging, and establishes a session for making HTTP requests. Additionally, it defines a callback function for writing data received during an HTTP request. With that being said, we can conclude that ves is responsible in giving data performance from O-DU to SMO. The ves_execute function handles the execution of VES events, which may involve sending performance metrics to SMO
## netconf
Netconcf.c is a part of a larger system dealing with NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) data management. The code initializes static variables for storing XPaths and values related to NETCONF configuration and operation. It also declares global variables for configuration data, alarm data, and a subscription context for NETCONF data changes. Furthermore, it defines functions for initializing NETCONF data handling, registering/unregistering callbacks, and handling data changes. Netconf_data is a part of a software component related to managing NETCONF data and alarms within the OpenAirInterface (OAI) Software Alliance project. There is also netconf_session which is a continuation of NETCONF session initialization and cleanup. It defines functions for initializing and freeing NETCONF sessions, including establishing connections with Sysrepo and starting sessions for operational and running data stores. Cleanup ensures proper resource release, such as releasing the Libyang context and closing NETCONF sessions. Netconf which includes initialization of NETCONF sessions to establish connections and sessions with devices managed by SMO. This allows SMO to send configuration to devices via NETCONF.
