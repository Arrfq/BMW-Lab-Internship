# **GenAI Usage Review Summary**
GenAI (Generation Artificial Intelligence) is an algorithms or called as AI model that create new content, including audio, text, and videos [3].

GenAI have many branches divided by models and architecture of the algorithms, and the data that is going to be generated. Most of the models and architectures divided into Autoencoder (have its own new branch called Transformers [6]), Autoregressive, Generative Adverarial Network (GAN), Diffusion & Flow-based, and Foundation Model [5]. While the data to be generated are mainly Text and Image, or both (Multimodal).

## **GenAI Usage in Computer Engineering Fields**
### **TestPilot by Max Schafer et. al.**
TestPilot is built for generating unit tests for npm packages written in JavaScript/TypeScript using a Large Language Model. it uses Open-AI gpt3.5-turbo on 25 npm packages to create a test case for the code using those 25 npm packages. There are no fine-tuning approach, but mainly about deployment into GitHub releases.

TestPilot Architecture [1].

TestPilot uses five main components:
1. API Explorer, analyzes the PUT to determine its API, includes set of functions, methods, constants, etc that is not private in the package (the code used as test case).
2. Documentation Miner, extract code snippets and comments from both separated documentation files, and inside code snippets. Authors mentioned about the limitation of the miner and using the doc comment (/**...*/)
3. Prompt Generator, constructs an initial prompt to send to the LLM for generating a test for a given function f, which has one signature and let the prompt refiner creates more metadata.
4. Test Validator, validate the candidate tests generated from the LLM, especially in syntatic errors using Mocha test runners.
5. Prompt Refiner, generate additional prompts to use for querying the model. It adds another prompts based on the cases happened in Test Validator.

LLM Model only used to generate candidate tests from the prompt generator, and all components in TestPilot doesn't use any LLM or AI algorithm, only hard coded rules. Note that the model using OpenAI inference server using it's API, without any training or architecture process.

## **GenAI Usage in 5G**
### **O-RAN Transformer-based Traffic Prediction and Network Optimization**
Transformer is an architecture of a machine learning algorithm that is popular in processing sequence data. It is implemented in this scenario to predict traffic in 5G, and optimize the network by defining a threshold for RIC application using the predicted values. The anticipated traffic generated by the Transformer is used in reinforcement leanring-based traffic steering xApp, or cell sleeping rApp to enhance the performance of the network [7]. The author mentions the energy efficiency gone up by 39.7% compared to the 'always on traffic steering xApp' and 10.1% increase in throughput compared to the 'always on cell sleeping rApp'.

Traffic prediction and network optimization [7].
### **O-RAN Chatbot by Nvidia**
O-RAN Chatbot is another example of GenAI Examples from Nvidia that showcase the usage of Nvidia environments and products, especially Nvidia AI Foundation Endpoints and NIM. NVIDIA NIM is a set of easy-to-use microservices for accelerating the deployment of foundation models on any cloud or data center and helps keep your data secure. The chatbot implements Retrieval Augmented Generation that works by storing related documents into a vector database, then using similarity algorithm between the prompt and use the similar data as context in chatbot model to generate a response based on the context alone.

O-RAN Chatbot demo [4].

From the codes, the example uses streamlit as the front end UI. The framework uses LangChain which is possible for multiple processes as one chain. Some features also introduced in the example.

The Chatbot model use Mixtral 8x7B, which is a large language model with 7B parameters specialized in generating responses. Only one LLM Model used in the whole architecture.
