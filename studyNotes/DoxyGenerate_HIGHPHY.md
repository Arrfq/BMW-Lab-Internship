# DOXYGEN API Document Generation
## Doxygen introduction
Doxygen is a widely-used documentation generator tool in software development. It automates the generation of documentation from source code comments, parsing information about classes, functions, and variables to produce output in formats like HTML and PDF. By simplifying and standardizing the documentation process, Doxygen enhances collaboration and maintenance across diverse programming languages and project scales.
## Installation guide
Doxygen can be installed [here](https://www.doxygen.nl/), just follow the installation step and you'll be ready to go. However, to generate a more complex graph, additional tool such as Graphviz is required. Graphviz can be downloaded [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/), in short, Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks.
