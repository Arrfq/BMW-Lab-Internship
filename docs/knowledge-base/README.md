## O-RAN Components

One of the key benefits of the Open RAN model lies in its commitment to vendor neutrality. This interoperability is maintained regardless of the specific equipment or software suppliers involved, breaking down proprietary barriers and fostering a more open, competitive ecosystem.

This is extended and enhanced by the E2 interface defined in O-RAN Alliance which together with O1 and O2 enable a standardised approach to the management, orchestration and support for real time telemetry exposure and control of the CU and DU nodes to bring AI/ML network intelligence in the RAN.

This vendor neutrality gives network operators the flexibility to integrate best-in-class solutions without being tethered to one provider.
