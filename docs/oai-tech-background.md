## 5G Core in Network

### Introduction

**What is 5G Core and why is 5G Core important?**

By definition 5G core is a core network architecture that implements the new 3GPP network architecture for 5G mobile networks. It is the heart of the 5G mobile network. 5G Core is important because it establishes a reliable, secure connectivity to the network for end users and provides access to its services.

5G core is designed to handle a wide variety of essential functions such as connectivity and mobility management, authentication and authorization, subscriber data management and policy management, etc. These network functions are designed as cloud-native and software-based which allow for a higher deployment flexibility and agility on multiple cloud infrastructures.


### Architecture

**General Architecture**

## O-RAN in 5G Network

### Definition

    O-RAN stands for Open Radio Access Network, which is a new paradigm for designing, deploying, and operating cellular networks. O-RAN networks are built with disaggregated components that are connected via open interfaces and optimized by intelligent controllers. This allows for multi-vendor, interoperable components and programmatically optimized networks through a centralized abstraction layer and data-driven closed-loop control. The O-RAN Alliance is defining a virtualization platform for the RAN and extending the definition of 3GPP and eCPRI interfaces to connect RAN nodes
    Architecture

### Architecture

    ![images](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r182-xBK3.png)

    The main architecture of O-RAN is based on key principles that have been at the center of the Software-defined Networking (SDN) transformation in wired networks in the past 15 years, and have started moving into the wireless domain more recently . The main architectural building blocks of O-RAN include the near-RT and non-RT RICs and the SMO. The O-RAN interfaces include E2, O1, A1, the fronthaul interface, and O2.


### Building Blocks

**RIC (Radio Intelligent Controllers)**

* RICs (Radio Intelligent Controllers) are essential components of the O-RAN architecture, facilitating control and optimization of the RAN (Radio Access Network).
* There are two types of RICs: near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC. The near-RT RIC handles real-time control and optimization, while the non-RT RIC handles non-real-time control and optimization.
* RICs connect to the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) through different interfaces: A1 for both RIC types, E2 for near-RT RIC, and O1 for non-RT RIC.
* RICs support the execution of third-party applications called rApps/xApps, enabling value-added services such as policy guidance, enrichment information, configuration management, and data analytics for RAN optimization and operations. They contribute to the networkâ€™s flexibility and programmability.

**O-DU (O-RAN Distributed Unit)**

* The O-DU is responsible for distributed baseband processing in the O-RAN architecture.
* It performs functions like digitization, modulation/demodulation, and low-level radio signal processing.
* Multiple O-DUs can be deployed in a distributed manner to cover a geographical area, improving scalability and reducing latency.

**O-CU (O-RAN Centralized Unit)**

* The O-CU is responsible for centralized baseband processing in the O-RAN architecture.
* It handles functions such as radio resource management, scheduling, and beamforming.
* The O-CU receives instructions from the O-RAN RIC and coordinates the distributed units (O-DUs) for radio transmission and reception.

**O-RU (O-RAN Radio Unit)**

* Open Interface: The o-RU follows a standardized protocol, allowing interoperability between different vendorsâ€™ equipment in the radio access network.
* Distributed Architecture: The o-RU works alongside the distributed unit (DU) to provide flexible and efficient radio access capabilities.
* Radio Signal Processing: The o-RU handles functions like modulation, demodulation, encoding, decoding, beamforming, and filtering for effective wireless signal transmission.
* Conversion: The o-RU converts digital baseband signals to analog RF signals for transmission and vice versa, enabling communication between digital and analog domains.
* Remote Configuration and Management: The o-RU can be remotely configured, managed, and monitored, facilitating efficient operation, parameter adjustments, and software updates without physical access.

**SMO (Service Management and Orchestration)**

![image alt](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ6Y8nQtn.png)

* The SMO (Service Management and Orchestration) is an important part of the O-RAN architecture that takes care of managing the RAN (Radio Access Network) and controlling different types of RICs (RAN Intelligent Controllers) that work in real-time and non-real-time.
* The SMO connects to the RICs through specific interfaces: A1 for both real-time and non-real-time RICs, E2 for real-time RICs, and O1 for non-real-time RICs.
* The SMO handles various management tasks like fixing faults, setting up configurations, keeping track of resources, monitoring performance, and ensuring security. It also manages services and resources, organizes the networkâ€™s structure, and handles policies for network operations.
* Acting like a bridge, the SMO coordinates different functions across the entire network. This allows special apps within the O-RAN system to gather information about the RAN. The SMO uses this information to make smart decisions about services, computing at the networkâ€™s edge, and how the network is divided into slices.
* The SMO is a crucial part of the O-RAN architecture that ensures everything runs smoothly and efficiently. It manages the RAN, controls different types of RICs, handles important management tasks, makes informed decisions based on gathered information, and optimizes network operations and services.
