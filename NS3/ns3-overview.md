## Basic Overview of NS3

In brief, ns-3 provides models of how packet data networks work and perform, and provides a simulation engine for users to conduct simulation experiments.

### Key Features
- **Modular Design**: NS3 is built in parts that can be easily added or changed.
- **Realism**: It provides detailed and realistic simulations.
- **C++ and Python**: You can write simulations in both C++ and Python.
- **Open Source**: NS3 is free to use and modify.

### Basic Components
- **Nodes**: These are like computers or devices in the network.
- **Applications**: Programs that generate and receive network traffic.
- **NetDevices**: Network interfaces like network cards.
- **Channels**: Paths through which data travels between nodes.
- **Protocols**: Rules for how data is sent and received, like TCP/IP.
