In this guide one of the challange is that :

1. O-RAN srsCU-srsDU customization 7.2x split option still not on the container format form to run
2. srsRU-Emu still not tested and integrated with srsDU and srsUE
3. Clocking Sync Integration with Linux PTP
4. Separated workspace due to limited computing resource

> Notes:
> 1. On srsRAN on Kubernetes Docs: showed that RU is not Emulation, CU & DU is not yet validated an O-RAN customized solution,
