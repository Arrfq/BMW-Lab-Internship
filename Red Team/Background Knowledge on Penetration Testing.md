## Introduction
### Five Phase of Ethical Hacking

1. Reconnaisance

Reconnaissance in cybersecurity is the process of collecting
information about a target without direct contact. Passive information gathering uses public sources, like Google,
to collect data without alerting the target. The aim is to gather information discreetly.

2. Scanning

  a. Scanning 

  Scanning in cybersecurity involves active information gathering by making direct connections to a target. 
  This process identifies open ports and services on the target, using tools like Nmap. 
  The goal is to map out the target's network and discover potential vulnerabilities.

  b. Enumeration

  Enumeration in cybersecurity is the process of identifying vulnerabilities or exploits in open ports and services on a target. 
  This step involves detailed probing to uncover weaknesses that can be exploited.

3. Gaining Access

In cybersecurity, gaining access involves direct attacks to exploit vulnerabilities 
and gain entry into the target system. This step is about executing attacks to take advantage of weaknesses and obtain unauthorized access.

4. Maintaining Access

In cybersecurity, maintaining access means keeping or increasing the level of access already obtained. 
This often involves privilege escalation and installing backdoors to ensure continued access to the target system

5. Covering Tracks

In cybersecurity, covering tracks involves restoring the target to its original state and removing any evidence of the attack. 
This includes erasing logs and removing backdoors to hide the attacker's activities and prevent detection.
