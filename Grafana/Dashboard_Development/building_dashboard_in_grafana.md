## Introduction

This progress report documents the development of two dashboards, AP Dashboard and Client Dashboard, within Grafana utilizing InfluxDB as the data source.  The dashboards are designed to monitor Access Points (APs) and Clients within a wireless network. The report outlines the goals of each dashboard and provides detailed explanations of the queries used to achieve these goals.

**Goal**
- Streamline network management and optimization through comprehensive data organization and analysis for APs and client devices.
- Enable detailed analysis and targeted troubleshooting by focusing on specific APs and clients, improving network performance.
- Enhance user experience by leveraging detailed metrics and visualizations to ensure optimal network operation.

* **Objective**
To create a comprehensive table displaying various parameters of APs across different buildings and floors.
* **Query**
```
from(bucket: "wifi")  
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "AP")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["ap_group_floor"] =~ /^${floor:regex}$/ and r["ap_group_building"] =~ /^${building:regex}$/)
 |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "channel_busy" or 
                        r["_field"] == "eirp_10x" or
                        r["_field"] == "radio_mode" or
                        r["_field"] == "sta_count" or
                        r["_field"] == "noise_floor" or
                        r["_field"] == "arm_ch_qual" or
                        r["_field"] == "rx_time" or
                        r["_field"] == "tx_time" or
                        r["_field"] == "channel_interference" or
                        r["_field"] == "channel_free")
 |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
 |> keep(columns: ["ap_name", 
                     "radio_band",
                     "radio_mode", 
                     "sta_count", 
                     "channel", 
                     "eirp_10x", 
                     "noise_floor", 
                     "arm_ch_qual",
                     "channel_busy",
                     "rx_time",
                     "tx_time",
                     "channel_interference",
                     "channel_free"])  
 |> drop(columns: ["rx_time", "tx_time", "channel_interference", "channel_free"])
 |> group()
```
* **Explanation**
Variables ap_group_building and ap_group_floor were created to filter data based on building and floor. The query uses these variables along with a series of filters to select relevant fields from the "AP" measurement. The data is then pivoted and grouped to display the required columns.

## Task 2: Specific AP Table

![image](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/internship/blob/2024-TEEP-4-Alifya/Assets/dashboard/apdas2.jpg)
    
* **Objective**
To create a table for a specific AP, showing detailed information.
* **Query**
```
from(bucket: "wifi")  
 |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
 |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "AP")
 |> filter(fn: (r) => r["ap_group_floor"] =~ /^${floor:regex}$/ and r["ap_group_building"] =~ /^${building:regex}$/ and r["ap_name"] =~ /^${apName:regex}$/)
 |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "channel_busy" or 
                        r["_field"] == "eirp_10x" or
                        r["_field"] == "radio_mode" or
                        r["_field"] == "sta_count" or
                        r["_field"] == "noise_floor" or
                        r["_field"] == "arm_ch_qual" or
                        r["_field"] == "rx_time" or
                        r["_field"] == "tx_time" or
                        r["_field"] == "channel_interference" or
                        r["_field"] == "channel_free")
 |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
 |> keep(columns: ["ap_name", 
                     "radio_band",
                     "radio_mode", 
                     "sta_count", 
                     "channel", 
                     "eirp_10x", 
                     "noise_floor", 
                     "arm_ch_qual",
                     "channel_busy",
                     "rx_time",
                     "tx_time",
                     "channel_interference",
                     "channel_free"])  
 |> drop(columns: ["rx_time", "tx_time", "channel_interference", "channel_free"])
 |> group()
```
* **Explanation**
A variable ap_name was created to filter data for a specific AP. The query follows a similar structure to Task 1 but includes an additional filter for ap_name. The resulting data is pivoted and grouped to display the required columns.

## Task 3: Client Numbers in Specific AP

![image](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/internship/blob/2024-TEEP-4-Alifya/Assets/dashboard/apdas3.jpg)
    
* **Objective**
To visualize the number of clients connected to a specific AP.
* **Query**
```
from(bucket: "wifi")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "AP" and r["ap_name"] =~ /^${apName:regex}$/)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "sta_count")
  |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
  |> keep(columns: ["_time", "sta_count"])
```
* **Explanation**
A bar chart is created using a query that filters data for a specific AP (ap_name) and selects the sta_count field, representing the number of clients.

## Task 4: Noise Floor in Specific AP

![image](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/internship/blob/2024-TEEP-4-Alifya/Assets/dashboard/apdas4.jpg)
    
* **Objective**
To display the noise floor for a specific AP.
* **Query**
```
from(bucket: "wifi")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "AP" and r["ap_name"] =~ /^${apName:regex}$/)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "noise_floor")
```
* **Explanation**
A query is used to filter data for a specific AP (ap_name) and select the noise_floor field, which is then visualized.

## Task 5: Channel Utilization for 2.4GHz & 5GHz Bands
    
![image](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/internship/blob/2024-TEEP-4-Alifya/Assets/dashboard/apdas5.jpg)

* **Objective**
To calculate and display the channel utilization for 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands in a specific AP.
* **Query**
```
from(bucket: "wifi")
 |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
 |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "AP" and r["ap_name"] =~ /^${apName:regex}$/)
 |> filter(fn: (r) => r["radio_band"] == "(2.4 or  5.0")
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>   r["_field"] == "rx_time" or
                        r["_field"] == "tx_time" or
                        r["_field"] == "channel_interference" or
                        r["_field"] == "channel_free")
 |> pivot(rowKey:["_time"], columnKey: ["_field"], valueColumn: "_value")
 |> keep(columns: ["ap_name", 
                     "rx_time",
                     "tx_time",
                     "channel_interference",
                     "channel_free"])  
 |> group()
```
* **Explanation**
A pie chart is created using a query that filters data for a specific AP (ap_name) and selects fields related to channel utilization (rx_time, tx_time, channel_interference, channel_free). The query calculates the total utilization for each band and displays it in the chart.
