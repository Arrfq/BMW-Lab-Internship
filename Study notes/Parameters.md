##  Received Strength Signal (RSS)
In the context of indoor positioning, RSS (Received Signal Strength) is used as a key metric to determine the location of devices within a building. By analyzing the received RSS values from multiple APs, a device can estimate its location. This is because the RSS value is influenced by the distance between the device and AP.

## Access Point Coordinates
These coordinates will be depicted as digital twin access points on the SionnaRT coverage map.

## Bandwidth
This parameter is crucial because channels 1, 6, and 11 are commonly used as standard operating channels for APs or routers. They do not overlap with each other, allowing for sufficient distance between channels and avoiding adjacent channel interference.

## Trasmit Power (EIRP)
Utilize transmit power to create heatmaps

## Monitoring Access Points
Monitoring APs involves checking their operational status to ensure they are functioning correctly and are accessible within the network.
