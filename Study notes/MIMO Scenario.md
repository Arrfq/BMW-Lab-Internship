# MIMO Scenario

## 1. Two Site SSB & CSI-RS Based
![alt text](images/mimo17.png)

**RSRP** 
- Indoor has a stable RSRP but the gain is quite low
- Pedestrian has a higher rsrp but is very volatile 

**Thp per UE**
- Indoor has a stable thp but quite low
- Pedestrian has a higher thp but is very volatile 

**Cell and UE Throughput (From Data)**
- Cell thp is higher than UE thp

**SSB & CSI-RS**
- Both are volatile but SSB is more stable than CSI-RS
